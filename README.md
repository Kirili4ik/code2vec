  * **code2seq** (ICLR'2019) is our newer model. It uses LSTMs to encode paths node-by-node (rather than monolithic path embeddings as in code2vec), and an LSTM to decode a target sequence (rather than predicting a single label at a time as in code2vec). See [PDF](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1gKYo09tX), demo at [http://www.code2seq.org](http://www.code2seq.org) and [code](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq/).
  * **Structural Language Models for Any-Code Generation** is a new paper that learns to generate the missing code within a larger code snippet. This is similar to code completion, but is able to predict complex expressions rather than a single token at a time. See [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00577.pdf) (demo: soon).
  * **Adversarial Examples for Models of Code** is a new paper that shows how to slightly mutate the input code snippet of code2vec and GNNs models (thus, introducing adversarial examples), such that the model (code2vec or GNNs) will output a prediction of our choice. See [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07517.pdf) (code: soon).
  * **Neural Reverse Engineering of Stripped Binaries** is a new paper that learns to predict procedure names in stripped binaries, thus use neural networks for reverse engineering. See [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09122) (code: soon).

This is a TensorFlow implementation, designed to be easy and useful in research, 
and for experimenting with new ideas in machine learning for code tasks.
By default, it learns Java source code and predicts Java method names, but it can be easily extended to other languages, 
since the TensorFlow network is agnostic to the input programming language (see [Extending to other languages](#extending-to-other-languages).
Contributions are welcome.
This repo actually contains two model implementations. The 1st uses pure TensorFlow and the 2nd uses TensorFlow's Keras ([more details](#choosing-implementation-to-use)).

## Quickstart
### Step 0: Cloning this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec
cd code2vec
```

### Step 1: Creating a new dataset from java sources
In order to have a preprocessed dataset to train a network on, you can either download our
preprocessed dataset, or create a new dataset of your own.

#### Download our preprocessed dataset of ~14M examples (compressed: 6.3GB, extracted 32GB)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/data/java14m_data.tar.gz
tar -xvzf java14m_data.tar.gz
```
This will create a data/java14m/ sub-directory, containing the files that hold that training, test and validation sets,
and a vocabulary file for various dataset properties.

#### Creating and preprocessing a new Java dataset
In order to create and preprocess a new dataset (for example, to compare code2vec to another model on another dataset):
  * Edit the file [preprocess.sh](preprocess.sh) using the instructions there, pointing it to the correct training, validation and test directories.
  * Run the preprocess.sh file:
> source preprocess.sh

### Step 2: Training a model
You can either download an already-trained model, or train a new model using a preprocessed dataset.

#### Downloading a trained model (1.4 GB)
We already trained a model for 8 epochs on the data that was preprocessed in the previous step.
The number of epochs was chosen using [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping), as the version that maximized the F1 score on the validation set. This model can be downloaded [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/java14m_model.tar.gz) or using:
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/java14m_model.tar.gz
tar -xvzf java14m_model.tar.gz
```

##### Note:
This trained model is in a "released" state, which means that we stripped it from its training parameters and can thus be used for inference, but cannot be further trained. If you use this trained model in the next steps, use 'saved_model_iter8.release' instead of 'saved_model_iter8' in every command line example that loads the model such as: '--load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8'. To read how to release a model, see [Releasing the model](#releasing-the-model).

#### Downloading a trained model (3.5 GB) _which can be further trained_

A non-stripped trained model can be obtained [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/java14m_model_trainable.tar.gz) or using:

```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/java14m_model_trainable.tar.gz
tar -xvzf java14m_model_trainable.tar
```  

This model weights more than twice than the stripped version, and it is recommended only if you wish to continue training a model which is already trained. To continue training this trained model, use the `--load` flag to load the trained model; the `--data` flag to point to the new dataset to train on; and the `--save` flag to provide a new save path.

#### A model that was trained on the Java-large dataset
We provide an additional code2vec model that was trained on the "Java-large" dataset (this dataset was introduced in the code2seq paper). See [Java-large](#java-large-compressed-72gb-extracted-37gb)

#### Training a model from scratch
To train a model from scratch:
  * Edit the file [train.sh](train.sh) to point it to the right preprocessed data. By default, 
  it points to our "java14m" dataset that was preprocessed in the previous step.
  * Before training, you can edit the configuration hyper-parameters in the file [config.py](config.py),
  as explained in [Configuration](#configuration).
  * Run the [train.sh](train.sh) script:
```
source train.sh
```

##### Notes:
  1. By default, the network is evaluated on the validation set after every training epoch.
  2. The newest 10 versions are kept (older are deleted automatically). This can be changed, but will be more space consuming.
  3. By default, the network is training for 20 epochs.
These settings can be changed by simply editing the file [config.py](config.py).
Training on a Tesla v100 GPU takes about 50 minutes per epoch. 
Training on Tesla K80 takes about 4 hours per epoch.

### Step 3: Evaluating a trained model
Once the score on the validation set stops improving over time, you can stop the training process (by killing it)
and pick the iteration that performed the best on the validation set.
Suppose that iteration #8 is our chosen model, run:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8.release --test data/java14m/java14m.test.c2v
```
While evaluating, a file named "log.txt" is written with each test example name and the model's prediction.

### Step 4: Manual examination of a trained model
To manually examine a trained model, run:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8.release --predict
```
After the model loads, follow the instructions and edit the file [Input.java](Input.java) and enter a Java 
method or code snippet, and examine the model's predictions and attention scores.

## Configuration
Changing hyper-parameters is possible by editing the file
[config.py](config.py).

Here are some of the parameters and their description:
#### config.NUM_TRAIN_EPOCHS = 20

## Features
Code2vec supports the following features: 

### Choosing implementation to use
This repo comes with two model implementations:
(i) uses pure TensorFlow (written in [tensorflow_model.py](tensorflow_model.py));
(ii) uses TensorFlow's Keras (written in [keras_model.py](keras_model.py)).
The default implementation used by `code2vec.py` is the pure TensorFlow.
To explicitly choose the desired implementation to use, specify `--framework tensorflow` or `--framework keras`
as an additional argument when executing the script `code2vec.py`.
Particularly, this argument can be added to each one of the usage examples (of `code2vec.py`) detailed in this file.
Note that in order to load a trained model (from file), one should use the same implementation used during its training.

### Releasing the model
If you wish to keep a trained model for inference only (without the ability to continue training it) you can
release the model using:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8 --release
```
This will save a copy of the trained model with the '.release' suffix.
A "released" model usually takes 3x less disk space.

### Exporting the trained token vectors and target vectors
Token and target embeddings are available to download: 

[[Token vectors]](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/token_vecs.tar.gz) [[Method name vectors]](https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/model/target_vecs.tar.gz)

These saved embeddings are saved without subtoken-delimiters ("*toLower*" is saved as "*tolower*").

In order to export embeddings from a trained model, use the "--save_w2v" and "--save_t2v" flags:

Exporting the trained *token* embeddings:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8.release --save_w2v models/java14_model/tokens.txt
```
Exporting the trained *target* (method name) embeddings:
```
python3 code2vec.py --load models/java14_model/saved_model_iter8.release --save_t2v models/java14_model/targets.txt
```
This saves the tokens/targets embedding matrices in word2vec format to the specified text file, in which:
the first line is: \<vocab_size\> \<dimension\>
and each of the following lines contains: \<word\> \<float_1\> \<float_2\> ... \<float_dimension\>

These word2vec files can be manually parsed or easily loaded and inspected using the [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) python package:
```python
python3
>>> from gensim.models import KeyedVectors as word2vec
>>> vectors_text_path = 'models/java14_model/targets.txt' # or: `models/java14_model/tokens.txt'
>>> model = word2vec.load_word2vec_format(vectors_text_path, binary=False)
>>> model.most_similar(positive=['equals', 'to|lower']) # or: 'tolower', if using the downloaded embeddings
>>> model.most_similar(positive=['download', 'send'], negative=['receive'])
```
The above python commands will result in the closest name to both "equals" and "to|lower", which is "equals|ignore|case".
Note: In embeddings that were exported manually using the "--save_w2v" or "--save_t2v" flags, the input token and target words are saved using the symbol "|" as a subtokens delimiter ("*toLower*" is saved as: "*to|lower*"). In the embeddings that are available to download (which are the same as in the paper), the "|" symbol is not used, thus "*toLower*" is saved as "*tolower*".

### Exporting the code vectors for the given code examples
The flag `--export_code_vectors` allows to export the code vectors for the given examples. 

If used with the `--test <TEST_FILE>` flag,
a file named `<TEST_FILE>.vectors` will be saved in the same directory as `<TEST_FILE>`. 
Each row in the saved file is the code vector of the code snipped in the corresponding row in `<TEST_FILE>`.
 
If used with the `--predict` flag, the code vector will be printed to console.


## Extending to other languages  

This project currently supports Java and C\# as the input languages.

_**April 2020** - an extension for code2vec that addresses obfuscated Java code was developed by [@basedrhys](https://github.com/basedrhys), and is available here:
[https://github.com/basedrhys/obfuscated-code2vec](https://github.com/basedrhys/obfuscated-code2vec)._


_**January 2020** - an extractor for predicting TypeScript type annotations for JavaScript input using code2vec was developed by [@izosak](https://github.com/izosak) and Noa Cohen, and is available here:
[https://github.com/tech-srl/id2vec](https://github.com/tech-srl/id2vec)._

~~_**June 2019** - an extractor for **C** that is compatible with our model was developed by [CMU SEI team](https://github.com/cmu-sei/code2vec-c)._~~ - removed by CMU SEI team.

_**June 2019** - an extractor for **Python, Java, C, C++** by JetBrains Research is available here: [PathMiner](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/astminer)._

In order to extend code2vec to work with other languages, a new extractor (similar to the [JavaExtractor](JavaExtractor))
should be implemented, and be called by [preprocess.sh](preprocess.sh).
Basically, an extractor should be able to output for each directory containing source files:
  * A single text file, where each row is an example.
  * Each example is a space-delimited list of fields, where:
  1. The first "word" is the target label, internally delimited by the "|" character.
  2. Each of the following words are contexts, where each context has three components separated by commas (","). Each of these components cannot include spaces nor commas.
  We refer to these three components as a token, a path, and another token, but in general other types of ternary contexts can be considered.  

For example, a possible novel Java context extraction for the following code example:
```java
void fooBar() {
	System.out.println("Hello World");
}
```
Might be (in a new context extraction algorithm, which is different than ours since it doesn't use paths in the AST):
> foo|Bar System,FIELD_ACCESS,out System.out,FIELD_ACCESS,println THE_METHOD,returns,void THE_METHOD,prints,"hello_world" 

Consider the first example context "System,FIELD_ACCESS,out". 
In the current implementation, the 1st ("System") and 3rd ("out") components of a context are taken from the same "tokens" vocabulary, 
and the 2nd component ("FIELD_ACCESS") is taken from a separate "paths" vocabulary. 

## Additional datasets
We preprocessed additional three datasets used by the [code2seq](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01400) paper, using the code2vec preprocessing.
These datasets are available in raw format (i.e., .java files) at [https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq/blob/master/README.md#datasets](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq/blob/master/README.md#datasets),
and are also available to download in a preprocessed format (i.e., ready to train a code2vec model on) here:

### Java-small (compressed: 366MB, extracted 1.9GB)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/data/java-small_data.tar.gz
```
This dataset is based on the dataset of [Allamanis et al. (ICML'2016)](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup/codeattention/), with the difference that training/validation/test are split by-project rather than by-file.
This dataset contains 9 Java projects for training, 1 for validation and 1 testing. Overall, it contains about 700K examples.

### Java-med (compressed: 1.8GB, extracted 9.3GB)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/data/java-med_data.tar.gz
```
A dataset of the 1000 top-starred Java projects from GitHub. It contains
800 projects for training, 100 for validation and 100 for testing. Overall, it contains about 4M examples.

### Java-large (compressed: 7.2GB, extracted 37GB)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/code2vec/data/java-large_data.tar.gz
```
A dataset of the 9500 top-starred Java projects from GitHub that were created
since January 2007. It contains 9000 projects for training, 200 for validation and 300 for
testing. Overall, it contains about 16M examples.

Additionally, we provide a trained code2vec model that was trained on the Java-large dataset (this model was not part of the original code2vec paper, but was later used as a baseline in the code2seq paper which introduced this dataset).
Trainable model (3.5 GB):
```
wget https://code2vec.s3.amazonaws.com/model/java-large-model.tar.gz
```

"Released model" (1.4 GB, cannot be further trained).
```
wget https://code2vec.s3.amazonaws.com/model/java-large-released-model.tar.gz
